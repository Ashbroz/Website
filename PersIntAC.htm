<h4 align="left"><u>Video Games</u></h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Video games is my favorite past time. I grew up playing so many differrent games and my passion for it has only kept growing. I own around 200+ games and I particuarly like Role-Playing Games (RPGs).
It has been something I've used to chill out and relax.</li>
	</ul>
<h4 align="left"><u>Sports</u></h4>
	<ul>
	<li>While I do love all sports, my favorite by far is soccer. I have played soccer since I was five and as a kid played against the youth academies of MLS teams like Atlanta United
	and Orlando FC. My personal favorite soccer team is Paris-Saint Germain, which I have supported since I was 13. My favoirte soccer player is Kevin De Bruyne, who plays
	for Manchester City in the English Premier League. Besides soccer, I support the Carolina Panthers in football since I grew up in North Carolina and
	the Charlotte Hornets for the NBA.</li>
	</ul>
<h4 align="left"><u>Investment Banking & The Stock Market</u></h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Since I was able to start investing when I turned 18, I have been a little bit obssessed with it every since.
	In fact, I am so obssessed with it that I intend to go into the career field of Investment Banking. For me, I just 
have a strong passion for finding companies that I know can be better in the future and love the process of looking into their fiancial statmenets, annual reports, etc. and
analyzing how good they could be in the future. After getting an internship with Citibank last year, my passion has only grown for the field and excited for the future.</li>
